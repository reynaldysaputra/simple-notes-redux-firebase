## `SIMPLE-NOTES-REDUX-FIREBASE : What project is this?`

The goal of the simple-notes-redux-firebase project is to create small notes on the users who will log in to this application.

In the project you will see login, registration features from firebase and also firestore to keep records on the application.

There's nothing fancy about the app's appearance but I've made the app run according to the diagram.

This project uses:
